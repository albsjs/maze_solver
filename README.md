# Maze Solver 

## Description
This is Maze Solver!! It is an awesome maze generator and solver, showing you it's progress in front of your eyes!

## "Why?" (Motivation/Goal/Problem to solve)

I undertook this exciting project as a part of the boot.Dev course but continued to build off of it to test my Python skills and learn to have fun with the code and build something that can have an interactive element to it!

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Install Maze_Solver using the Python toolchain

```bash
python install github.com/albsjs/maze_solver
```

## Run zipzod with an input directory and an output file

```bash
zipzod -i ./input -o ./output.zip
```
## Usage
This is where you'll want to show off more of the advanced features of your project. Think of this as the larger reference manual, or the comprehensive technical documentation. For example:

## ðŸ“– Usage

Available flags:

- `-i` - The input file or directory
- `-o` - The output file or directory
- `-v` - Verbose output
- `-h` - Show help
- `-p` - The number of parallel workers to use (default 4)
- `-d` - The maximum depth to traverse (default 1)
- `-f` - The file extensions to include (default .txt, .md)

## Examples

Unzip a file

```bash
zipzod -i ./input.zip -o ./output
```

Zip with a different number of workers

```bash
zipzod -i ./input -o ./output.zip -p 8
```
